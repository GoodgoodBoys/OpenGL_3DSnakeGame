OpenGL Snake Game

This project is a practice for learning OpenGL. Some of the code is sourced from the OpenGL official website: https://learnopengl.com/. The project draws images in 3D space and is a derivative of my SMFL 2D Snake game project.
The project has realized the basic functions of the Snake game, including the movement of the snake's body, the random generation of food, and the generation of obstacles on the map. The smooth movement of the snake's body has been achieved, and its body grows after feeding.
